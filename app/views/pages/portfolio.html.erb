		<p>This successful business owner wanted a powerful online home for her new boat rental/dinner cruise company. She needed something that would help "reel" in new customers, showcase their numerous services, allow customers to book tickets to their events online, and display their beautiful location on Greenwood Lake, NJ. I created a Search Engine Optimized website with a contemporary, nautical design that beautifully reflects the personalities of both the business and its entrepreneurial owner.</p>

		<p>These busy food business owners needed help establishing an online presence that allowed their customers to view their menu and order food online. Showcasing their homemade dishes, family run atmosphere, and online delivery ordering with a unique, fun design was important to them. They also needed to incorporate large photos of the food and the store without slowing down the site. I worked to create a bold and colorful design with a clean, modern twist and a fast backend optimized for large photos.</p>
